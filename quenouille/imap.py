    Function consuming tasks from any iterable, dispatching them to a pool
    of threads and finally yielding the produced results.

    Args:
        iterable (iterable): iterable of jobs.
        func (callable): The task to perform with each job.
        threads (int): The number of threads to use.
        ordered (bool, optional): Whether to yield results in order or not.
            Defaults to `False`.
        group_parallelism (int, optional): Number of threads allowed to work
            on the same group at once. Defaults to no limit.
        group (callable, optional): Function returning a job's group.
            This argument is required if you need to restrict group parallelism.
        group_buffer_size (int, optional): Max number of jobs that the function
            will buffer into memory when waiting for a thread to be available.
            Defaults to 1.
        group_throttle (float or callable, optional): Optional throttle time to
            wait between each task per group. Can also be a function taking
            the group & current item and returning the throttle time.
        group_throttle_entropy (float, optional): Optional random time between 0
            and chosen value to wait in addition to `group_throttle`. Defaults
            to no entropy.
        listener (callable, optional): Function that will be called when
            some events occur to be able to track progress.

    Yields:
        any: will yield results based on the given job.
